## What is the Playground?

The Playground is a distributed learning community around decentralized
systems. We're funding 6-week long learning adventures to create knowledge
and explore the future of learning organizations.

You can read more [here](https://github.com/fathom-playground/playground)

## Who are we?

The fathom team has been working on building the foundational infrastructure
for a decentralized learning ecosystem, an assessment system for the last 2 years.

The Playground is essential to our roadmap for launching the fathom network.
It is building towards our vision of an open universal learning ecosystem
from multiple fronts, both providing the bootstrapping process for the
network of assessment as well as exploring a plurarlity of interconnected
learning structures.

## Funds  in the Playground

The Playground is funded directly by donations in ETH or DAI. These are then
distributed directly to adventurers.

Funds will be controlled by a
[multisig](https://github.com/ConsenSys/MultiSigWallet) with keys held by at
least 3 parties.

Funds are directly distributed to adventurers via smart-contracts that permit
freezing but not withdrawing (a la Burnable Payments). This process is
detailed [here](https://github.com/fathom-playground/playground/#how-does-it-work)

# Vision
The Playground is a testing ground for learning. We want to explore how new
systems, tools, and ideas can help people create knowledge. 

It's a space in which these structures can incubate, where they
can be developed by a community of like-intentioned individuals thinking
deeply about learning and how can be pushed forward.

However, this is not meant to be divorced from concrete utility. Learning must be
tied to the goals and needs of real beings and communities. The Playground
reflects that and aims to create value in the field it operates, decentralized
systems. We want to push forward ideas and the research systems that create
them, as well as the resources and tools individuals use to learn them.

In all this the Playground should be deeply connected to the broader community
of learners, working towards collective goals.

## Decentralized Systems

This (re)emerging field is the perfect vanguard for a wave of new powerful
learning systems. Not only does it have a breakneck pace of development, but
it's ideas and concepts provide tools for thinking about and restructuring
learning in the form of consensus systems, cryptography, and data structures.

# v1 Roadmap
For the first step we're keeping the Playground small. We will be running 10
adventures over a maximum of 3 months.

Our goal is to validate the core mechanisms of the Playground to enable us to
iterate on it's design.

## Areas to validate 
### 1. Fathom 
Fathom is a key part of the Playground. A decentralized system of assessment
is essential for individuals to be able to shape their own learning. The
Playground is intended to explore how such a system would be used in a
community of learners. 

#### Key Questions
- What tools and systems are neccessary for interacting with the fathom
protocol
- What are the most immediate and natural use-cases for decentralized
credentials in a learning community
- Are individuals able to come to consensus on assessments
- Are individuals able to create the concepts they need

### 2. Playground Parameters and Structures
- Are the amounts, duration, and constraints around adventures optimal
- Are the tools and systems we're using to collaborate working towards our goals
- Is our review process effective and fair?

## Learning from v1
We'll be conducting incoming and outgoing interviews with all adventurers
and a sample of adventure applicants.

These will then be compiled into a public retrospective before we fund any
additional adventures. This will be stored in the [retros](/retros) folder. 
This file will then be changed to incorporate any differences in our funding
process as well as our new roadmap moving forward.
