The Playgrounds funds are controlled by [this](LINK TO ETHERSCAN) multi-sig with
keys held by X parties.

Anyone can donate funds directly to this address and can be publicly recognized
in the `DONORS` file.

All funds for the playground will be directly distributed to Adventurers and
Reviewers as described [here](https://github.com/fathom-playground/playground).

## The needs of the Playground
Currently we are bootstraping the Playground. The goal is to run 10 adventures
in order to explore how they interact with the rules of the playground and to
iterate on the systems. This requires $50,000 (at $5000 per adventure).

Our timeline is flexible as it depends on the quality of adventure proposals but
should be less than 6 months.

### Questions we will answer

- What structures best support the needs of learners
- Are the amounts and time-periods for adventures appropriate
- Are there are any componenets of the playground that are't being supported appropriately
- What are extraneous elements of the Playground
- Which organizations and communities can we support and partner with

### Data Points
The main source of data in the playground is adventures themselves. These, and
the things they link to, show the main impact and things achieved. 

We can also use issues created to gauge what learners had trouble with, as well
as comments left through the Playground process (on MRs, Proposals, and PLIPs)

### Reflection and Moving forward
Once 10 adventures have been funded and run we will carry out a public
retrospective sourcing inputs from all the adventure participants as well as the
reviewers and organizers. That will be organized in this repository and stored
in the [retros](/retros) folder.

This file will then be modified to reflect our current needs and goals.

## Why fund the Playground
The Playground is creating a decentralized **learning** community around the
concepts and ideas of decentralized systems. It is promoting both the creation
of new knowldege _and_ new systems for creating knowledge.

This can have a broad impact, both in the field of decentralized systems and
on learning in all areas.
